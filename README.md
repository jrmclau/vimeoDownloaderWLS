# vimeoPrivateVideoDownloader
With this script you can download private videos from Vimeo. It's a bash script, and requires jq and curl installed. Credit to the primary project from which this was forked: https://github.com/c1sc0/vimeoPrivateVideoDownloader

It requires two URLs that you can get from the Developer mode > Network tab (in Chrome, Firefox and others). Simply update the script with those urls and run it to download the video.
