# vimeoDownloaderWLS
The intent of this script is to allow you to download private videos from Vimeo using Bash on Ubuntu on the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem. It is a bash script, and requires jq and curl installed. 

It requires two URLs that you can get from the Developer mode > Network tab (in Chrome, Firefox and others). Simply update the script with those urls and run it to download the video.
